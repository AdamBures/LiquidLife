# LiquidLife
For the MEGA Hackathon 2023, LiquidLife was created as a project with the goal of increasing public awareness of water waste and providing solutions to address it. To educate people about the issue and motivate them to act, the initiative offers a platform that displays statistics on the quality of the water in various nations.

In order to decrease water waste and enhance the supply of clean water, the platform also offers water filtration options. LiquidLife seeks to encourage people and communities to embrace sustainable behaviors and have a good impact on the environment by disseminating knowledge about the best water filtration systems.
